### Library Service Project

An online system to manage library book borrowings, payments via Stripe, and Telegram notifications. 
Built with Django REST Framework, Docker, and Celery.

## Introduction

In many libraries, managing inventory, borrowings, and overdue fines is still a manual process. 
This project solves that by providing a fully functional back-end system that:

Allows users to register, log in, and borrow books.

Automatically calculates payments for borrowings via Stripe.

Sends Telegram notifications on borrowing, return, and overdue cases.

Allows admins to monitor borrowing activity.

No front-end is required ‚Äî it works via DRF browsable API and Swagger docs.
